### _HAND-SELECTED, HSK LEVEL-VARIABLE, CUSTOMIZABLE STUDY CARD DIGITAL SERVICE_

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This Android application provides Mandarin learners with an offline, self-tailorable review and dictionary service.  Downloaded locally, onto their device, comes a searchable database with 100,000+ character entries (which is especially handy when needing access to characters without phone service).  Users can select their HSK level and then, at a minimum, customize review vocabulary via easy-to-use flipcards.  And the app integrates a local Room (Android) database, on-device, ensuring the user's preferred state persistence.

## FOREWORD

Many learners struggle to access structured Mandarin vocabulary self-tailored to their level; existing apps are often subscription-based and/or lack [any] customization.  This project provides a free, simple, customizable alternative where learners can study HSK-aligned vocabulary and expand their deck with personal notes.  This project is built with inspiration from the developer's own, personal journey into learning Mandarin and having issues with Quality of Life (QoL) features across different language learning apps.  Though this is not a commercial product, it is a project satisfying not only banal requirements for a University semester project as an illustrative learning example, but, also, the developer's own vestedly-interested desires concerning their language-learning.  Future versions will, undoubtedly, continually interate moving forward; as, the project aims for top marks both academic _and_ serviceable in the Mobile Application market; so, why not provide the service, indefinitely, adding features as able?

## VERSIONS
The first iteration of this service aims to provide a TTS-centric (Text-to-Speech), litely-gamified personalized review and notation service coupled with quick-access to what is often considered the gold standard of Chinese character collections (CC-CEDICT).  Future versions need center around phrasebuilding; grammar and context learning; audiovisual samples and reviews; AI- and live-partner-speech practice; and beyond.
