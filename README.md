### _HAND-SELECTED, HSK LEVEL-VARIABLE, CUSTOMIZABLE STUDY CARD DIGITAL SERVICE_

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This Android application provides Mandarin learners with an optionally-offlineable, self-tailorable review and dictionary service.  Users can select their HSK level and then, at a minimum, customize review vocabulary via easy-to-use flipcards; and, optionally, download locally, onto their device, a searchable database with 100,000+ characters (especially handy when needing access to characters offline).  The app integrates external data via complimentary GitHub filehosting (in lieu of an for-profit API) â€” which, data can be ported to a local Room (Android) database, on-device, ensuring the user's preferred state persistence.

## FOREWORD

Many students struggle to access structured Mandarin vocabulary tailored to their level; existing apps are often subscription-based and/or lack [any] customization.  This project provides a free, simple, customizable alternative where learners can study HSK-aligned vocabulary and expand their deck with personal notes.  This project is built with inspiration from the developer's own, personal journey into learning Mandarin and having issues with QoL (Quality of Life) features across different language learning apps.  Though this is not a commercial product, it is a project satisfying not only banal requirements for a University semester project as an illustrative learning example, but, also, the developer's own vestedly-interested wants concerning language-learning.  Future versions will, undoubtedly, continually interate moving forward; as, the project aims for top marks both academic _and_ serviceable in the Mobile Application market; so, why not provide the service, indefinitely, adding features as leisure allows?

## VERSIONS
The first iteration of this service aims to provide a TTS-centric (Text-to-Speech), litely-gamified personalized review and notation service coupled with quick-access to what is often considered the gold standard of Chinese character collections (CC-CEDICT).  Future versions need center around phrasebuilding; grammar and context learning; audiovisual samples and reviews; AI and live partner speech practice; and beyond.

### Design Notes
Native Unicode glyphs were chosen as part of design philosophy:  This service stresses functional accessibility and lack of bloat is part of guaranteeing access.  æˆ‘çš„ å¿«é€Ÿ HSK should be able to run on all devices Android 4.4 (KitKat) and later; this way, even the user's old "potato" phone â€” lying around, collecting dust â€” can be repurposed into a pocket Chinese dictionary (e.g.  in the event of not being able to use one's main device[s]).
